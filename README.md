# Full-stack-Python-Project
This is a personal Full-stack project that I started this month and will continue to add to.

 It show cases some of the combined skills and experience I have. The project is primarily written in Python, with HTML templates being used for webpage displays. 
 A database is created using SQLite that may be edited (create/delete) data points from the webpage to simulate an ERP managing company databases.

#Step 1
If you decide to test this product, ensure to run main.py after pulling. This will launch the server and create the database connection. The database included in this GIT is a simple example in regards to relational databases.

#Step 2
Launch your webpage from localhost:5000/index - Then you will be able to navigate the desired pages. If you do not include '/index' - you will be Obi-wan'd ;).

Note: The login.py file is a dev file and not currently functional.

# Full-stack-Python-Project
This is a personal Full-stack project that I started this month and will continue to add to.

 It show cases some of the combined skills and experience I have. The project is primarily written in Python, with HTML templates being used for webpage displays. 
 A database is created using SQLite that may be edited (create/delete) data points from the webpage to simulate an ERP managing company databases.

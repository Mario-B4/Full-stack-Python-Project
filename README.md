# Full-stack-Python-Project
This is a personal Full-stack project that I started this month and will continue to add to.

 It show cases some of the combined skills and experience I have. The project is primarily written in Python, with HTML templates being used for webpage displays. 
 A database is created using SQLite that may be edited (create/delete) data points from the webpage to simulate an ERP managing company databases.

#Step 1
If you decide to test this product, ensure to run main.py after pulling. This will launce the server and create the database. The Database included in this GIT is an example of the one created by the program.
